# Sama-AI
An all-time accessible AI-powered soul mate within your reach

**Team #3 Project** for HackDuke x Meta 2025 Hackathon 

Description:

We're building an audio-based conversational AI companion named Sama, designed to chat and interact naturally with users through spoken conversation. Sama speaks and listens just like a person would, utilizing OpenAI's Whisper API for speech-to-text conversion, locally deployed Coqui TTS for voice generation, and Groq-deployed Llama 3 for dynamic text processing and conversation generation.

Sama is imagined as a playful and endearing Japanese live-streamer character who loves gaming, anime, and joking around. To make conversations feel genuinely personal, we've integrated an advanced memory module capable of instantly recalling vast amounts of information—think the entire Harry Potter series—so Sama can remember every detail users share, creating a sense of companionship and personalized friendship.

Inspired by the liveliness of popular AI Twitch streamer Neuro Sama, which has attracted significant attention despite being closed-source, we're striving to replicate and enhance that engaging, interactive experience. Our ultimate goal is to develop Sama into an intuitive virtual desktop companion that not only converses but also visually interacts with users' screens, accompanies them throughout daily tasks, and even joins in playing games like Overcooked.

Right now, we're focused on improving Sama's voice to sound even more vibrant and expressive through advanced text-to-speech models, reducing interaction latency further, and enabling natural conversational dynamics where Sama can seamlessly interrupt or be interrupted—just like in real human interactions.

In the near future, we're excited to give Sama a visible presence right on your desktop and empower her with screen-reading capabilities. Eventually, we envision Sama becoming a constant and delightful companion who actively participates in your digital life, creating a richer, more enjoyable interactive experience.
